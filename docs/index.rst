***************************
PCMDI Metrics Package (PMP)
***************************

The Program for Climate Model Diagnosis & Intercomparison (`PCMDI`_) Metrics Package (PMP) is used to provide "quick-look" objective comparisons of Earth System Models (ESMs) with one another and available observations.  
Results are produced in the context of all model simulations contributed to CMIP6 and earlier CMIP phases.  
Currently, the comparisons emphasize metrics of large- to global-scale annual cycle and both tropical 
and extra-tropical modes of variability. 
Recent release (v3) include established statistics for mean climate, ENSO, MJO, extratropical modes of variability, 
regional monsoons, and high frequency characteristics of simulated precipitation as a part of U.S. DOE's Benchmarking of simulated precipitation. 

`PCMDI`_ uses the PMP to produce `quick-look simulation summaries across generations of CMIP <https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/metrics>`_.

Getting Started
===============
Installation requirements and instructions are available on the :ref:`install` page

An overview of the summary statistics available via the package 
are summarized with interactive Jupyter notebooks in the :ref:`metrics` page

Some installation support for CMIP participating modeling groups is available: pcmdi-metrics@llnl.gov

The PMP expects model data to be `CF-compliant <http://cfconventions.org/>`_, otherwise, 
to successfully use the package may require some input data conditioning. 
It is also strongly suggested to work with observation datasets following the `CF-compliant <http://cfconventions.org/>`_, 
such as datasets from the `obs4MIPs`_ project.
