PMP Metrics
*****************

We provide documentation along with demos to assist users of the PMP.  Most demos are simple examples on how to apply the PMP to one or several datasets.  Example parameter files used for more complex appication of the PMP (e.g., applying the PMP across all CMIP models) via the sample setups used by PCMDI for semi-operational application to the CMIP database. 

A suite of demo scripts and interactive Jupyter notebooks are provided with `this documentation <https://github.com/PCMDI/pcmdi_metrics/blob/master/doc/jupyter/Demo/README.md>`_.
