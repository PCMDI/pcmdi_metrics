Overview
========

The mean climate summary statistics are the most routine analysis available from the PMP.  At the same time, because of the number of options available they do require some preparation in advance of the analysis, including:

* Placement of observational climatologies

* Preparation of model climatologies 

* Construction of an input parameter file
