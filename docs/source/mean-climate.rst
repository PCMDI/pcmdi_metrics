Mean Climate

Overview
========

The mean climate summary statistics are some of the most routine analysis available from the PMP.  At the same time, because of the number of options available they do require some preparation in advance of the analysis, including:

* Setting observational climatologies

* Preparation of model climatologies 

* Construction of an input parameter file  

Observational climatologies
###########################

A database of `observational climatologies <https://github.com/PCMDI/PCMDIobs-cmor-tables/blob/master/catalogue/pcmdiobs2_clims_byVar_catalogue_v20201210.json>`_ is available to users of the PMP. To obtain this, please contact the PMP user group (pcmdi-metrics@llnl.gov) and you will promptly provided with the database.  A subset of this database is available via the demo data made available for the PMP tutorials via a `jupyter notebook demo <https://github.com/PCMDI/pcmdi_metrics/blob/master/doc/jupyter/Demo/Demo_0_download_data.ipynb>`_ or via the version of python included as part of the PMP environment.
