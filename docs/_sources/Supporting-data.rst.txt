*****************
Retrieving data for demos and use of the PMP
*****************

Overview
========

Sample model and observational data are provided via a `jupyter notebook demo <https://github.com/acordonez/pcmdi_metrics/blob/645_notebooks/doc/jupyter/Demo/Demo_0_download_data.ipynb>`_.

For users that are unfamiliar with Jupyter notebooks, a little python code for retrieving the demo data is repeated below. :: 

    import requests
    r = requests.get("https://pcmdiweb.llnl.gov/pss/pmpdata/cmec_tutorial_files.txt")
    with open("data_files.txt","wb") as f:
       f.write(r.content)


To retrieve these sample files locally, one first sets the location where they want the demo data to be stored locally. ::

    demo_data_directory = 'MyDemoPath' 


The last line sets the demo_output directories. After that, data is downloaded as follows: ::

    import cdat_info
    cdat_info.download_sample_data_files("data_files.txt", demo_data_directory)


First, make sure you are in a functioning PMP environemnt (see :ref:`install`).
