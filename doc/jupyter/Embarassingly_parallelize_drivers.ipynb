    "# Embarassingly parallelize drivers\n",
    "\n",
    "Often enough a *driver* or *diagnostic* use case can be considered as **embarassingly parallel** for example the code loops over several *models* or *variables* or *scenarios*, etc...\n",
    "\n",
    "In some case it makes sense to include the loop as part of the driver in order to optimize data re-use (e.g all model will be compared to the same set of observation and these require heavy pre-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "But sometimes this is not necessary and all the added loops can make the code cumbersome and hard to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pcmdi_metrics package offers a simple solution for emabrassingly parallel code provided they are based on the [Community Diagnosis Package](https://cdp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)'s arguments parser.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is simple, identify parameters over which your code is embarassingly parallel. Make sure these parameters are declared as argument inputs to your driver, define the ***granularize** option to your input parsameter file and use **parallelize_driver.py** to run your driver in an embarassingly parallel way.\n",
