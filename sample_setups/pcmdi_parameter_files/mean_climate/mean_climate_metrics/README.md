Mean climate parameter files
----------------------------

These are examples for use with the mean climate driver.

### E3SM parameter file  

This template is provided as a starting point for the E3SM team to run the PMP mean climate metrics. It is organized into two main  
sections: 'Options set by user', where parameters like model settings and file paths are set, and 'Advanced settings', which can usually be  
left as the defaults. Options from the parameter file can be overwritten in the command line as well.  

Usage:  
`mean_climate_driver.py -p e3sm_parameterfile.py <-other options>`

### Calculations across multi-model ensembles

Simple parallelization done via bash script:

 'bash MIP_EXP_all.bash'
