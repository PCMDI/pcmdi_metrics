# Parallel run scripts

These scripts were used to generate sea ice results for CMIP models at LLNL. They may require adjustment or rewriting before they can be used on other systems such as NERSC. The CMIP5 and CMIP6 scripts (sea_ice_parallel_cmip5*.py and sea_ice_parallel_cmip6*py) rely on xsearch to find model files.  

These can provide a reference for how to set up CMIP model runs.
