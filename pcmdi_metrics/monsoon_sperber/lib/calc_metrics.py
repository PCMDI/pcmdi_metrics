""" Calculate metrics based on Sperber and Annamalai 2014 Clim. Dyn.,
which are:
- onset pentad index: when fractional accumulation hit 20%
- decay pentad index: when fractional accumulation hit 80%
- slope: slope between onset and decay pentad time step indices
- duration: duration of monsoon period as index
calculated from cumulative pentad time series
