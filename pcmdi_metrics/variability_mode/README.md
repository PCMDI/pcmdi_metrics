### EOF1 based variability modes
- NAM: Northern Annular Mode
- NAO: Northern Atlantic Oscillation
- SAM: Southern Annular Mode
- PNA: Pacific North American Pattern
- PDO: Pacific Decadal Oscillation

### EOF2 based variability modes
- NPO: North Pacific Oscillation (2nd EOFs of PNA domain)
- NPGO: North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (2nd EOFs of PDO domain)
